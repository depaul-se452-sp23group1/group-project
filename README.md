**Meeting Journal**

We all met in MS Teams and disucssed about the various scope areas. 
We then finalised on developing an E-commerce application (basic shopping application).
We then created a git repository for our project.
After assigning the functional areas for each team member, each of us tried to make changes in the README file and push it to the repository.
We finally created the Spring Skeleton with the above mentioned configurations and pushed it to the Git repository.
As of now everyone is working on their functional tables.
